## Felony

Lisp dialect written in Haskell. Scheme is to Felony as a scheme is to a felony - whatever that means.

Felony is not a finished language, and will probably remain a toy; unless someone cares a whole lot!

## What's implemented:

- Primitives: Anything needed to define pretty much any function you'd want (except low-level systems stuff)
- Basic semantics
- Syntax

## What will be implemented:

If I find the time (!!), I will implement:

1. Threading & concurrency
2. Mutability
3. Error handling
4. First-class environments
5. Standard libraryw
