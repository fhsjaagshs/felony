## Felony

Lisp dialect written in Haskell. Scheme is to Felony as a scheme is to a felony - whatever that means.

Felony is not a finished language, and is far from production-ready.

### Goals

1. To be a kick ass language!
2. To learn something in making a language

### TODO

**Language**

1. More concurrency features (thread objects)
2. Modules (? don't know if possible ?)
3. Functional language features
4. decisions about toplevel evaluation (should it be wrapped in a begin call?)
5. Standard library
6. New function definition syntax

**Parsing**

1. Comments
2. Fix issues with dotted lists
3. Real vs Integer parsing issue
