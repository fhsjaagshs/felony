## Felony

Lisp dialect written in Haskell. Scheme is to Felony as a scheme is to a felony - whatever that means.

Felony is not a finished language, and is far from production-ready.

### TODO
**Evaluation**

1. new function definition syntax
2. decisions about toplevel evaluation (should it be wrapped in a begin call?)

**Parsing**

1. Comments
2. Fix issues with dotted lists
3. Real vs Integer parsing issue
