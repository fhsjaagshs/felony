## Felony

Lisp dialect written in Haskell. Scheme is to Felony as a scheme is to a felony - whatever that means.

Felony is not a finished language, and will probably remain a toy; unless someone cares a whole lot!

The idea is to remain as brief as possible; under 1000 lines of code, ideally under 400-500.

## What's implemented:

- Primitives: Anything needed to define pretty much any function you'd want (except low-level systems stuff)
- Basic semantics
	- if/quote/define/bind!/lambda
	- curried & scoped procedure evaluation
- Syntax

## What will be implemented:

If I find the time (!!), I will implement the TODO in `src/Felony/Semantics.hs`.
